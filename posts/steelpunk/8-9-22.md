**August 9th - Devlog 1**

![alt_text](/img/steelpunk/8-9-22/image2.png "image_tooltip")

There has been about 6 weeks of work done already, going back and forth on concepts, gameplay, setting, aesthetics. 

A game idea always starts as a vague daydream where every aspect can still be doubled back on, exaggerated, canned, and just forgotten about. The act of development reveals more and more of the true image of the idea, and often this image is embarrassing and ugly compared to the original idealized dream, like when you hear your own voice in a recording and realize how you sound to everybody else. Playtesting a game of this scale in its early stages can give you a real feeling of despair. 

The debates are not over, but the game has now reached a point where progress is starting to feel linear in a particular direction. The fact that when we play it now we can actually have fun and easily imagine ways to improve it has motivated me to commit to this devlog, which hopefully will remain semi consistent each Monday going forward.

Code

This last week has been a lot of refactoring - I’ve been consuming a lot of content on design patterns and I’ve come to the awakening that inheritance is evil. I’ve always relied on inheritance (and OOP stuff in general) because my first language was Java, and I’ve always had an easy time modeling my program structure in my head in terms of objects and definitions which encapsulate one another. But I think I’m finally starting to get the procedural/functional philosophical understanding that the true important pieces of a program are what happens, not its underlying model of data. 

Previously I had all of my enemies inheriting from an Enemy class, and having all of my netcode inheriting from a NetworkEntity class, but I’ve spent a lot of this week restructuring those things into individual components or fields on other downstream classes and its allowed me to remove a lot of annoying code. 

A good example was I had trouble with channeling the OnNetworkSpawn event down to my child classes, but now that my entities inherit directly from NetworkBehaviour, I don’t need to worry about that and can just write the function as is. The lifecycle code in general is much cleaner now, and everything actually works finally. Even the flying enemies. 

Level Design

Previously our level was very open, basically a bunch of walkways floating in space. I’ve added a bunch more physical objects between these to fill in the space, as well as more boundary walls. This has dramatically improved gameplay as now I can use wallrunning to get past groups of enemies and aren’t basically doomed whenever a Beamer enemy locks on to me since I can angle myself behind obstacles.

I still have trouble falling off of walkways when I’m not looking where I’m going, but once the kick rocket jump is implemented this should give us a good get out of jail free card for recovery. 

Gameplay

I made it so the viewmodel shirt for the grenade launcher matches the shirt color selected in the player data settings. I also fixed the wave counter and redesigned the health bar to be more cool (and also work properly now). 

Enemy Behavior

I’ve been testing Beamer's behavior and I think it would be much better to give the player the ability to dodge at the last second, but we need a way for this to happen without it basically meaning that as long as you're moving it will miss. So I’m working on a way for him to note the player's velocity just before impact and predict their future position based on that. I worry a bit about latency with this physics-based approach but hopefully it’ll be fine.

Particles:

I was looking at more ideas for particle meshes since it seems like a good way to move forward with these effects is with the use of meshes over sprites. Some ideas I was testing were 3 different icospheres meshed together in blender which produced an effect that might look good with the use of VFX studio to dissolve the meshes in a more “grainy/dematerializing” manner.

Animations:

The grenade launcher animation is being revised but kept at the same timings since the current frame count’s heft feels good. In particular im cleaning up the reload anims to be more “punchy and responsive looking”

I think for any future weapon models they should try and follow the same structure as the grenade launcher. The inclusion of many bells and whistles to yank and push on as a reload is a good idea, stay away from things like tiny objects and small switches that must be delicately animated.

**Design Pain Points**

**	**These are the design choices we haven’t fully crystallized or documented yet. Usually not unjustifiably, since these are tough calls and will determine a lot of the fun factor of our game. I think it's worth putting these in the log for posterity and at the very least we can use this to formally write out our thoughts rather than talking and then forgetting what we talked about.


### Barrels/Chips:

Right now the way barrels are going to work is they will be queued up, then activated, giving the player a full mag of ammo modified by the barrels property. (Ex: chance to stun, crit, add Doomed effect, heal, etc).

I feel like the true value of the barrels system is the tactics and fun factor of picking the right barrel at the right instant. My idea is to have barrels on a time-based cooldown and have them have a one-time effect on the bullet you fire immediately after activating it. I imagine things like:



* Barrel which teleports you to the point of impact
* Barrel which swaps your position with an enemy
* Barrel which stuns enemies immediately
* Barrel which creates a beam along the arc of the bullet that deals damage to enemies which walks through it
* Barrel which places grenades at the bullet impact
* Barrel which lets you shoot two portals that spawn at the point of impact which last for a period of time
* Barrel which spawns a turret which shoots bullets with whatever barrels were activated on that bullet which spawned it

I think these ideas are all super awesome and play into that (imo) super fun playstyle like that Chess 2 video of chaining a bunch of abilities in sequence, especially for ideas like the fists + swords, while also having the extra dimension we add of being able to combine these effects all at once. This model also lets us do crazy things like if rather than shooting you kick immediately after activating barrels it applies the effects to the kick, same with the hand-thrown ability (grenade/mine/etc). 

Where this clashes: This runs into issues with weapons that don’t have distinct, discrete firing options. The auto target healing beam weapon and fully automatic weapons don’t make a lot of sense with this. Personally I would be okay with removing non-semi-auto weapons from the game just to make this core element work more tightly. Alternatively, we can turn these weapons into semi-auto, for example the beam weapon can have distinct “shocks” where the beam glows and it does the effect, while still having the auto-aim benefits. For ergonomic reasons weapons should still auto-fire reload while holding mouse 1, but at a much lower fire rate than something like an smg so we can have discrete firing states which give the players opportunity to use their barrels. 

Chips:

I think any effect we want to last longer than one shot ought to be a chip, which will be perpetual. Right now, we pick the weapon at the start and we are stuck with it. This has a few advantages:



1. We can go deeper into creating chips for specific weapons (ie grenade launcher into rocket launcher) since people will spend more time with it.
2. We could spawn client-side loot tailored for each player’s specific weapon.


### Loot:

How is loot going to be spawned in a fun way?

**Thomas**

Some ideas:



* A particular passive enemy spawns which when killed drops items*
* Random chance to drop on any enemy kill*†
* Finish a set of rounds with a particular “score” to get more drops at the end of a set of rounds (aka room clear)
* Always get some loot after a room clear*
* Need to do something in world to get loot
    * Getting to a particular location
    * Killing enemies near a certain object (like cod feeding souls)
* No loot during rounds, need to use money to buy from the shop between rounds/room clears

    *Easy to implement


    †Hard to balance



### Death + Falling off:

How will we handle falling off in the aether?

This will probably be clearer once we implement more recovery options, but we may want to give the player another shot if they fall off the edge, maybe with reduced health, rather than just executing them for the whole wave.
